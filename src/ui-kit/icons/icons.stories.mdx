# Icons

An Icon is a piece of an visual element, but we must ensure its accessibility while using it. It can have 2 purposes:

- **Decorative only:** for example, it illustrates a label next to it. We must ensure that it is ignored by screen readers, by setting aria-hidden attribute `<ui-kit-icon :icon="'alert-triangle'" aria-hidden></ui-kit-icon>`

- **Non-decorative:** it means that it delivers information. For example, an icon as only child in a button. The meaning can be obvious visually, but it must have a proper text alternative via aria-label for screen readers. `<ui-kit-icon :icon="'alert-triangle'" aria-label="Print this document"></ui-kit-icon>`

## Usage

Insert the icon like this: `<ui-kit-icon :icon="'alert-triangle'"></ui-kit-icon>`.
